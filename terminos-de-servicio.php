                    Up stairs, therefore, I went; and, seated on a window, <a class="rojo39">with Mr. Brown at her
                        side</a>,
                    sat Miss Polly. I felt a little awkward at disturbing them, and much more so at
                    their behaviour afterwards; for, as soon as the common enquiries were over, Mr. Brown
                    grew so fond and so foolish, that I was extremely disgusted. Polly, all the time,
                    only rebuked him with, "La, now, Mr. Brown, do be quiet, can't you?-you should not
                    behave so before company.-Why, now, what will Miss think of me?"-While her looks
                    plainly showed not merely the pleasure, but the pride which she took in his caresses.
                    I did not by any means think it necessary to punish myself by witnessing their tenderness;
                    and therefore telling them I would see if Miss Branghton were returned home, I soon
                    left them, and against descended into the shop."So, Miss, you've come again," said
                    Mr. Branghton; "what, I suppose you've a mind to sit a little in the shop, and see how
                    the world goes, hey, Miss?" I made no answer; and M. Du Bois instantly brought me a chair.
                    Up stairs, therefore, I went; and, seated on a window, with Mr. Brown at her side,
                    sat Miss Polly. I felt a little awkward at disturbing them, and much more so at their
                    behaviour afterwards; for, as soon as the common enquiries were over, Mr. Brown grew
